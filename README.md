## My Work

09-README-Generator-NodeJS 

### Description:
In this week's Challenge I created a command-line application to automatically generate professional README files from a template and user input using node modules, npm, and inquirer.

### Installation:
You must ensure to have the Node modules installed, along with npm. To run the app invoice the JavaScrip index file using node.

### Usage:
This app is best used for the highperforming developper who needs to make professional readme files on the fly. Just run the app and start typing and interactin in the terminal, et voila!

### Tests:
In the future, I will go the extra mile and write tests for this application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
